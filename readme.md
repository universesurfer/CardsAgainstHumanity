Cards Against Humanity

##Description

This project is bringing Cards Against Humanity to a format that is fun and playable online.


Cards Against Humanity is a party game in which players complete fill-in-the-blank statements using words or phrases typically deemed as offensive, risqué or politically incorrect printed on playing cards. The game is available as a free download that players can print to create their own cards, and also available to purchase as a published hard copy. Its development originated from the successful Apples to Apples card game released years earlier and a Kickstarter campaign and received acclaim[citation needed] for its simple concept backed up by its satirical content. The game is available under a Creative Commons license BY-NC-SA. Its title references the phrase "crimes against humanity", reflecting its politically incorrect content.
